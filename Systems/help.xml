    The 3D-model still holds the CC 3.0 BY NC SA license, everything else is GNU GPL v3 License.
    
    This version is now going forward and will give you a full automatic flight control-system,
    lots of animations, instrumentation and full Multiplayer support for Parachuters and Elephant transport.
    Liveries, Fire fighting and SAR rescue is in preparation.

                                  ABOUT

Russian made Helicopter. First flight in 1957.
Main Rotor diameter: 35 m (114 ft 10 in)
Tail Rotor diameter: 6 m 30 cm
Fuselage length: 33 m 18 cm (108 ft 10 in)
Total length: 41 m 74 cm
Powerplant: 2x Solowjow D-25W (gas turbine) 4101 kW each
MaxTakeOff 93696 lb  Variant Poschar up to 20 tons of cargo

Exclusively made for FlightGear (www.flightgear.org)

Get ready:
Start up the engines by opening the red box in the overhead panel and click on the switch, middle mouse click will shut down the engines.
Set the Reference Compass at the engineer panel, magnetic variation is shown as tooltip, set needle to marker position.
Altitude and/or pressure settings in the Altimeters in inHG, mmHG or hPa (as tooltip), the Autopilot will work with this values (not with the HUD-infos).
Check cargo and/or payload: press y to switch to the towing control and open the red box, for loading cargo (elephant) and/or paratroopers.

The Autopilot in the cockpit will control most of your flight, do not use the generic one or mix them together.

Rudder Control with : Couple
Elevator-Trim with  : IAS and Floating Pitch
Collective(Throttle): ALT and APPR
Ailerion-Trim       : AP (wing-leveler), HDG, NAV, GPS

There is a wheel for rotor-tilt: -5 is for high speed, +5 is for backwards flight, 3,25 is a good value for normal take off, you may control your speed with it.
There is a wheel for Floating-Pitch: this is a full automatic vertical control for landing and starting, -5 is about 50 cm per second down, +5 is up.
Be aware of the ground effect, a Floating-Pitch of -3 lets you descent but not land, you will hoover around in 2-5 meter high, finally set it to -5.

In all flight situations the Coup (rudder-trim control) should be activ. Use the rudder to set your heading in floating conditions.
For more speed than 60kt the elevator-trim has to be at the top (+1) position, with a rotor tilt of -5 you will get 160kt speed then.
Use the elevator-trim to reduse the speed befor aproaching or let this be done by the IAS, the change to Floating-Pitch controll and use only the rudder for heading and rotor tilt for speed control.

For additional comfort the HUD will show you the values of the controlled axis and some more informations.
Some instruments will show you metric values, some ft/knots.

On the very left side you have a panel with 5 green lamps, the lower 3 are for trim-neutralisation, used after the Autopilot is dissabled.
The upper two you may press to get the latest METAR infos on screen.

Usage of the Autopilot panel in the top middle console:

- Heading Control: Heading Bug (HDG) is to set in the HSI (Horizontal Situation Indicator (with 4 green markers).
- Velocity Control: Speed with Pitch are set in the Speed Indicator, push IAS and turn needle (left from HSI), do not use for speeds below 80kt.
- Pitch/Attitude Control pitch and altitude wheels changes values.
- Wing leveler is activ when you push the AP button, it is also the AP activating/deactivating Button.
- APRP is used for intersepting the Glide Scope.
- GPS for flying routes from the Route Manager.
- ALT is holding your attitude.
- ILS/NAV is activated by the left MP-Kurs radio in the engineer panel.

For ILS Landing you may use the HSI, it gives you the indication that ILS and/or Glide Scope is intersepted (if not, red flags comming up).
ILS heading works even far out the stream, for the glidscope you should wait till the indicator is in nearly horizontal position (yellow line).

There are 3 Altimeters: the left one is electrical and gets the information from Radio or GPS signals, in meter and mmHG,
the upper one is in meter and mmHG, a tooltip shows you the Value in hPa, the lower one is in ft and inHG,
they are connected and you should set them to the ATIS information of the airport befor starting or landing.

The compass is cleared of the magnetic variation if you set the reference compass in the engineer panel to the orange marker position.

On top of the horizontal heading indicator (HSI) is a white scale, it will show you the wind drift derivation.
There are indicators for over-loading and parking brake.

Besides the starter switch is the switch for rotor brake on and off.

Paratroopers can be set up in the payload menue, each is 120 lb, they need a open back door to jump out, use the switch on the panel to give the signal :)
An Elephant is waiting to go back to Africa, press y to go to the towing control.
You find some instruments in this additional ramppanel, the middle instrument is for ground- and air-speed with a switch on the bottom.
There is a warning light for overload (sign: BEC).
